\section{Design of }
\label{design}

In this section, we introduce the design of the . We first present the problem formulation. Then, we present an overview of its structure. Finally we present a detailed description of its components and related algorithms.


\subsection{The Problem Formulation}
\label{problemformulation}

The formulation of the problem is as follows: 

To be successful, it must demonstrate



\subsection{Architecture Overview}
\label{architecture}

The RSUs are installed as follows: 


The RSUs communicate with the vehicle. The steps are as follows:


Now the detailed components. Describe the motivation for design choices.  
 

The consequences of the design choices:


\subsection{Design Considerations}

Tradeoffs and pitfalls

If there are parameters, are they chosen auotmatically or self-adaptive?
